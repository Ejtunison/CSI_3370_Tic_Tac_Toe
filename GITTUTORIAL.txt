Before you clone the repository, make sure you have a public/private key set up.

Once this is done, open a Git bash where you want the base folder of the repository to go (mine is in my folder for this class)
execute the following command:

git clone git@github.com:Ejtunison/CSI_3370_Tic_Tac_Toe.git

There are different branches for each section, to switch to any given branch, execute the following command:

git checkout "branch_name"  (remove double quotes when executing the command)

If you have made any changes to any files in the repository (or added anything new), you will need to actually add those
changes to the respository.

Open a git bash within the repository, there should be a light blue label in parentheses indicating which branch of the
repository you are working in.

Step 1: git status (this command shows all local changes to the repository)

Step 2: git add file_names (you need to individually add all of the changed files using this command, replace "file_name" with the
					actual file's name)
				
Step 3: git commit -m"insert message here" (this command commits the changes to the repository, but does not push them)

at this point it is good practice to do a "git pull" which pulls the most recent changs to the repository
Once this is done, test your code to make sure it still works and then start at Step 1 again.

Once you are sure there are no more changes to be made and everything works AND it's all been committed, the final command is:

git push (this command pushes your committed changes to the repository so everyone with access to the repository can see them
